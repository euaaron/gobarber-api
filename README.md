# GoBarber API

GoBarber API is the backend behind "GoBarber Web" and "GoBarber App", it was made during the GoStack Bootcamp provided by Rocketseat.
It was made originally on a branch of another repo where I store everything I made during the bootcamp, but now I decided to make a single repo for each GoBarber part like I would do with a professional project.

More info soon.
